## Overview

The statistics conversion process should be able to take a semi-structured spreadsheet of data and convert it into RDF data cubes.

The original spreadsheets are likely to be provided as multi-sheet Excel Spreadsheets. 

A test sheet uploaded to Google Documents is available at [here](https://spreadsheets1.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?hl=en_GB&key=tnZ9hnXI8jr7XgKGN_ac0cA&hl=en_GB#gid=0)

The first sheet is this saved as india-page1.csv.

The resulting RDF model is shown in india-1.n3
