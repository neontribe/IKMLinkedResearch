        <comment>The aim of the questionnaires is to include key measures of the child outcome variables (health, nutritional status, cognitive development and educational achievement), and factors that are likely to affect these outcomes as well as outcomes measured in later rounds. It is important to remember that the child questionnaire is just one data collection instrument and will be used in conjunction with country-specific modules/questions, the household and the community questionnaire.</comment>

        <label>Section 1: Time use and work activities";
	rdfs:comment "Poverty affects the roles and responsibilities assumed by children and the ways in which they use their time. This section aims to establish the range of activities undertaken by children on a daily basis and over the course of a year. This information then provides a context for obtaining children’s perspectives on their lives and roles, as well as for asking about their social support, skills and other feelings (see later sections).  The questions complement data collected in the household questionnaire and detailed justification for the inclusion of these topics can be found in the household questionnaire justification document. As in the household questionnaire, some of the questions on child work are taken from the International Labour Organisations (ILO) standardised survey, which was developed as part of the Statistical Information and Monitoring Programme on Child Labour (SIMPOC) (Jensen 2001). The school and work questions also draw on the experiences of the UNICEF (1999) and the World Bank’s (2001) Voices of Poor Children. As the children grow older, their labour market roles change, and become closer to the labour market roles taken on by adults. The labour market questions therefore also draw on the experiences of the Tanzania and Ghana Household worker surveys, designed by The Centre for the Study of African Economies (CSAE) at Oxford University in collaboration with the Ghana Statistical Office (GSO) and the Tanzania National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). These surveys were designed to analyse the labour market experiences of adults aged 15 years and older. The questions also draw on the experience of the World Bank LSMS surveys (Grosh and Glewwe, 2000).

While the information about school and work is collected over the previous 12 months, the previous day’s activities are collected in more detail to give an idea of the balance of time spent on different activities by the child. This section also gives detailed information about the child’s leisure activities. Children have different perspectives on their time use and activities to their caregivers, so it is essential to ask these questions directly to the 15 year-olds.

Some changes have been made to this section since Round 2, to reflect the changing labour market roles of the children. The section begins by asking the child to classify their activity status. This information will help the enumerator to frame their questions. It will also be of interest to compare this “standard” classification with the information later in the questionnaire. 

A wider definition of work is adopted than that used in Round 2; children are asked about anything they did to help their families or to get things for themselves, including paid or unpaid jobs or chores done at home. The reason for widening the definition is that qualitative work in Young Lives communities has found that many children who answer negatively to the question “have you done work or anything to get money or things for yourself or your family” actually have substantial work commitments. Further, domestic work and chores often have significant impacts on the lives and well-being of children, in particular on their school attendance, and on the time they are able to spend studying. The Round 3 questionnaire therefore hopes to capture these forms of work in more detail, as well as asking the children whether they or their household receive any form of payment for their work. The Round 2 question is, however, retained for comparison.

Children are asked to report wages for whatever time period they find easiest. Combined with information on the amount of time the child spent working, this will make it possible to calculate an hourly wage rate. This makes it possible to compute, for example, rates of return to education, as well as making it possible to assess the contribution these children make to household income.
  
As in Round 2, children are not asked whether they like doing paid work, but are asked what they like and dislike about their main occupation. This is an important distinction, since research with working children has shown that children’s views about work go beyond a simple ‘like’ or ‘don’t like’. Children demonstrate a nuanced understanding of the pros and cons of work. It is important to get the whole picture about child labour to accurately inform any policies concerning it. Questions about uses of any money earned helps to build up a picture of how work can, in some cases, benefit children, and help them to develop their own identity and independence. 

Injuries and illnesses incurred whilst doing paid work and whilst helping out with family farms, businesses, or chores, are a significant risk for young people. The survey therefore includes a set of questions on hazards children face whilst doing work activities, and about any injuries or illnesses, these activities may have caused. The questions cover all health hazards suggested by ILO, with the addition of some hazards that urban children may face, such as being close to moving vehicles or driving.</label>

        <comment>A subset of the items used in the household questionnaire is used to explore children’s expectations for their future and whether they feel these are attainable. For example, the length of time they would like to spend in education, the kinds of work they will be doing aged 25 and the skills they will need for this, and the age at which they will pass through key life stages such as parenthood. As well as allowing for collection of children’s attitudes, which are important as they are likely to influence their later behaviour (Leone et al. 1999), this will allow for the comparison of intergenerational attitudes on this subject. (More detailed information on these measures is included in the justification of the household questionnaire.) 

A key aim of the YL project is to research the effects of poverty on children’s psychosocial capacities. The focus on capacities reflects the recognition that children often demonstrate great resilience in the face of adversity to the extent that this can be understood to be ‘ordinary’ (Masten 2001). However, different aspects of poverty are hypothesised to affect children’s psychosocial capacities in different ways. For example, the facets of poverty in which they grow up will influence children’s agency (their ability and opportunity to make their own decisions). This may increase or decrease their feelings of pride and shame, agency, trust, and stigma and discrimination. These themes are also explored in section 11 of the caregiver’s questionnaire, to allow for a comparison of the feelings and perceptions of caregivers and children. 

The method used is a Likert-type response scale in which children indicate their dis-/agreement with various statements in terms of how much they sound like themselves. This Likert scale has 5 points with a ‘don’t know’ option included in the coding, as for other questions in the questionnaire, if children really cannot answer. A 5 point scale is widely recommended, for example by Likert (1933), DeVellis (2003), and Nunally and Bernstein (1994). We used 5 faces to symbolise the 5 different answer options and increase participant ease in answering these questions.</comment>

        <comment>The information collected in this section allows the children to be linked to future rounds and to the household, anthropometry and community surveys. The identification information is also useful for quality checks and for locating individual questionnaires if there are data queries. It is essential for continuity purposes that it is consistent between rounds in a panel survey.</comment>

        <comment>Minimising the respondent burden, recall error, question clarity, order and sensitivity were considered when designing the YLS questionnaire. The YLS aims to cover the multidimensional nature of childhood poverty rather than to investigate single issues in depth. This was quite a challenge for this questionnaire, as there are many new issues that are relevant to 15-year old children in the study countries. However we had to prioritise, as our target was to have an instrument that did not take longer than about an hour, given that we also conduct cognitive tests and a self-administered questionnaire on more sensitive issues. A first analysis of round 2 allowed us to eliminate questions that elicited a high degree of non-response or not-applicable answers. The priority was given to longitudinal consistency and questions that had a clear purpose for research. Finally, during piloting, questions that were difficult to administer, were not clearly enough worded or appeared to trouble the child were dropped or reformulated.</comment>
